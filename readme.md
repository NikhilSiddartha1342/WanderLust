🏡 WanderLust - Full-Stack Web Application for Listings & Reviews
🚀 About the Project
WanderLust is a full-stack web application for users to explore, create, and review property listings like villas, hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals. It’s built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clean code separation and scalability.

This project demonstrates my ability to build secure, dynamic, and interactive web applications using modern technologies and industry best practices like:
1)User authentication
2)Session management
3)RESTful routing
4)Data validation
5)Error handling
6)Flash messaging
7)Template rendering
8)Database schema modeling
